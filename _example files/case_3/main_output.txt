NOTE: In some conditions a zero titrate concentration was detected. Zero concentrations will be used to set data limits but will not be fitted.

Solving system...
`ftol` termination condition is satisfied.
Function evaluations 9, initial cost 8.6827e+13, final cost 9.0144e+10, first-order optimality 5.31e+05.
